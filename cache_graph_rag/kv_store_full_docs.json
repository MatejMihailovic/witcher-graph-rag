    "content": "vi shading his eyes with his hand, civril watched the sun emerge from behind the trees. the marketplace was coming to life. waggons and carts rumbled past and the first vendors were already filling their stalls. a hammer was banging, a cock crowing and seagulls screeched loudly overhead.  looks like a lovely day,  fifteen said pensively. civril looked at him askance but didn t say anything.  the horses all right, tavik?  asked nohorn, pulling on his gloves.  saddled and ready. but, there s still not many of them in the marketplace.   there ll be more.   we should eat.   later.   dead right. you ll have time later. and an appetite.   look,  said fifteen suddenly. the witcher was approaching from the main street, walking between stalls, coming straight towards them.  renfri was right,  civril said.  give me the crossbow, nohorn.  he hunched over and, holding the strap down with his foot, pulled the string back. he placed the bolt carefully in the groove as the witcher continued to approach. civril raised the crossbow.  not one step closer, witcher!  geralt stopped about forty paces from the group.  where s renfri?  the half-blood s pretty face contorted.  at the tower. she s making the sorcerer an offer he can t refuse. but she knew you would come. she left a message for you.   speak."

    "content": "yennefer leant out of the bed, grasping a faun   engraved on the pole   by a piece of anatomy well adapted to being grasped. without taking her eyes off geralt, she picked a coat with a fur collar up off the floor and wrapped herself up in it tightly before getting up. she poured herself another mug of juice without hurrying, drank it in one go, coughed and came closer. geralt discreetly rubbed his lower back which, a moment ago, had collided painfully with the wall.  geralt of rivia,  repeated the sorceress, looking at him from behind black lashes.  how did you get in here? and for what reason? you didn t hurt berrant, i hope?   no. i didn t. lady yennefer, i need your help.   a witcher,  she muttered, coming up even closer and wrapping the coat around her more tightly.  not only is it the first one i ve seen up close but it s none other than the famous white wolf. i ve heard about you.   i can imagine.   i don t know what you can imagine.  she yawned, then came even closer.  may i?  she touched his cheek and looked him in the eyes. he clenched his jaw.  do your pupils automatically adapt to light or can you narrow and dilate them according to your will?   yennefer,  he said calmly,  i rode nonstop all day from rinde. i waited all night for the gates to open. i gave your doorman, who didn t want to let me in, a blow to the head. i disturbed your sleep and peace, discourteously and importunately. all because my friend needs help which only you can give him. give it to him, please, and then, if you like, we can talk about mutations and aberrations.  she took a step back and contorted her lips unpleasantly.  what sort of help do you mean?   the regeneration of organs injured through magic. the throat, larynx and vocal cords. an injury caused by a scarlet mist. or something very much like it.   very much like it,  she repeated.  to put it in a nutshell, it wasn t a scarlet mist which has injured your friend. so what was it? speak out. being torn from my sleep at dawn, i have neither the strength nor the desire to probe your brain.   hmm . . . it s best i start from the beginning."

    "content": "streak of the blade with her eyes. geralt stopped abruptly, froze with his sword raised. the striga, disconcerted, also stopped. the witcher traced a slow semi-circle with the blade, took a step in the striga s direction. then another. then he leapt, feigning a whirling movement with his sword above her head. the striga curled up, retreated in a zigzag. geralt was close again, the blade shimmering in his hand. his eyes lit up with an ominous glow, a hoarse roar tore through his clenched teeth. the striga backed away, pushed by the power of concentrated hatred, anger and violence which emanated from the attacking man and struck her in waves, penetrating her mind and body. terrified and pained by feelings unknown to her she let out a thin, shaking squeak, turned on the spot and ran off in a desperate, crazy escape down the dark tangle of the palace s corridors. geralt stood quivering in the middle of the hall. alone. it had taken a long time, he thought, before this dance on the edge of an abyss, this mad, macabre ballet of a fight, had achieved the desired effect, allowed him to psychically become one with his opponent, to reach the underlayers of concentrated will which permeated the striga. the evil, twisted will from which the striga was born. the witcher shivered at the memory of taking on that evil to redirect it, as if in a mirror, against the monster. never before had he come across such a concentration of hatred and murderous frenzy, not even from basilisks, who enjoyed a ferocious reputation for it. all the better, he thought as he walked toward the crypt entrance and the blackness that spread from it like an enormous puddle. all the better, all the stronger, was the blow received by the striga. this would give him a little more time until the beast recovered from the shock. the witcher doubted whether he could repeat such an effort. the elixirs were weakening and it was still a long time until dawn. but the striga could not return to her crypt before first light, or all his trouble would come to nothing. he went down the stairs. the crypt was not large; there was room for three stone sarcophagi. the slab covering the first was half pushed aside. geralt pulled the third vial from beneath his tunic, quickly drank its contents, climbed into the tomb and stretched out in it. as he had expected, it was a double tomb   for mother and daughter. he had only just pulled the cover closed when he heard the striga s roar again. he lay on his back next to adda s mummified corpse and traced the sign"

    "content": "there s no reward for it.   that s not a bad idea. hey, karelka, borg, carrypebble! any of you there?  a town guard entered with a halberd on his shoulder, the blade catching the doorframe with a crash.  carrypebble,  said caldemeyn.  get somebody to help you and take the donkey with that muck wrapped up in the horse-blanket, lead it past the pigsties and chuck the kikimora in the cesspool. understood?   at your command. but . . . alderman, sir    what?   maybe before we drown that hideous thing    well?   we could show it to master irion. it might be useful to him.  caldemeyn slapped his forehead with his open palm.  you re not stupid, carrypebble. listen, geralt, maybe our local wizard will spare you something for that carcass. the fishermen bring him the oddest of fish   octopedes, clabaters or herrongs   many have made some money on them. come on, let s go to the tower.   you ve got yourselves a wizard? is he here for good or only passing?   for good. master irion. he s been living in blaviken for a year. a powerful magus, geralt, you ll see that from his very appearance.   i doubt whether a powerful magus will pay for a kikimora,  geralt grimaced.  as far as i know it s not needed for any elixirs. your irion will only insult me, no doubt. we witchers and wizards don t love each other.   i ve never heard of master irion insulting anyone. i can t swear that he ll pay you but there s no harm in trying. there might be more kikimoras like that on the marshes and what then? let the wizard look at the monster and cast some sort of spell on the marshlands or something, just in case.  the witcher thought for a moment.  very well, caldemeyn. what the heck, we ll risk a meeting with master"

    "content": "myself. i wonder, witcher, do you always try to dissuade your employers as strongly as you are me? time is slipping away. answer, yes or no?   yes.   that s better. that s better, geralt. your answers are much closer to the ideal. they re becoming more like those i expect when i ask a question. so. discreetly stretch your left hand out and feel behind my throne.  geralt slipped his hand under the yellow-blue drapery. almost immediately he felt a sword secured to the leather-upholstered backrest. a sword well-known to him.  your majesty,  he said quietly,  not to repeat what i said earlier about killing people, you do realise that a sword alone will not defeat destiny?   i do,  calanthe turned her head away.  a witcher is also necessary. as you see, i took care of that.   your maje    not another word, geralt. we ve been conspiring for too long. they re looking at us, and eist is getting angry. talk to the castellan. have something to eat. drink, but not too much. i want you to have a steady hand.  he obeyed. the queen joined a conversation between eist, vissegerd and mousesack, with pavetta s silent and dreamy participation. drogodar had put away his lute and was making up for his lost eating time. haxo wasn t talkative. the voivode with the hard-to-remember name, who must have heard something about the affairs and problems of fourhorn, politely asked whether the mares were foaling well. geralt answered yes, much better than the stallions. he wasn t sure if the joke had been well taken, but the voivode didn t ask any more questions. mousesack s eyes constantly sought the witcher s, but the crumbs on the table didn t move again. crach an craite was becoming more and more friendly with the two brothers from strept. the third, the youngest brother, was paralytic, having tried to match the drinking speed imposed by draig bon-dhu. the skald had emerged from it unscathed. the younger and less important lords gathered at the end of the table, tipsy, started singing a well-known song   out of tune   about a little goat with horns"
